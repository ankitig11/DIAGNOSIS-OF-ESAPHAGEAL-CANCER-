The study implements a comprehensive comparative analysis of three prominent convolutional neural network architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. Each model is evaluated using transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained ImageNet weights while adapting to the specific requirements of medical image classification. The methodology encompasses systematic data preprocessing, stratified dataset splitting, rigorous training protocols, and comprehensive performance evaluation using clinically relevant metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve analysis.
